- Timetracking (how many spend hours on what features):
    We found a tutorial in the internet and followed structure regarding to thah tutorial. 
    about 4 hours is enough for just doing app but we spend more time to discuss in levels and learn something from each part.
    because of that it took too much time for us. We didn't calculate exactly but I could say more than 10 hours for discussing and so on.

- What parts of the project you found were easy:
    creating component and connect to main component. simple coding and all similar to each ohter. import, coding, and export to main page. 
    at the same time it was interesting.

- What parts were hard:
    Adding weather condition and information codes was complicated. It was totally based on coding and some parts was difficult to understand.
    
- What was the greatest learning experience for you during the project:
    First, we learned that it is a different component in it and React working with components. We could create different components and frameworks and we could use those components whenever we want.
    In our case simply we created few components like title component, form component, weather information component and the main component which contain all other components in it.
    First, we created react app on our computer via command lines like
    npm install create-react-app -g
    create-react-app weather-react-app which install all necessary needs for configuration in our chosen directory
    then npm start to lunch default react application which we need to work on it and make changes to our project
    we cleaned some default codes like app.css, app.js and some others because tutorial want to start from the beginning
    then adding import code for each file which we want to create connections and get codes from that file
    import React from “react”;
    important note. To import some files or component, first we have to export that file from the file itself, otherwise, we will get an error in import.
    in src folder, we created the component folder and added each component file in it
    from this point, everything goes similar and for each one, we did the same thing to create a file and connect to app.js.
    what we liked in react, is this part that we simply could component separately and add those to anywhere we needed.

- Any additional info you might want to provide. (edited):
    We worked on this tutorial as team and discussed each steps with each other.
